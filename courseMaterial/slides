What is data type
static type vs dynamic type languages Java/Javascript

Java has two fundamental kinds of data types: primitive and reference .

primitives - 
  numeric data types - byte short char int long float double boolean
  Ranges - Diagram
  range circling- > negative to positive
  
  char data type  " is an integer type , stores integre , non negative , unicode character.
  float and double store large but imprecise values. Java follows IEEE
  754 standard . You may go through it to learn more but it is not required for
the exam.
  
  void
  
Primitive data types as building blocks for reference types

Size of primitive vs reference

The exam expects that you know them all. Although Oracle have
substantially reduced the number of questions that are based solely on quirky
syntax, you may still see weird syntax used in code snippets in questions that test
you on something else.

pass by value , pass by reference

by default a decimal value is of type double, in order to explixitly make a decimal value as float or double we write f & d notations

Declare and initialize variables (including casting
and promoting primitive data types

equality operator on complex types
string concatenation using + & += operators
increment/decrement operators on wrappers
